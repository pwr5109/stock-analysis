# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
This project was to analyze the performance of set of stocks during a certain time. We working to create better code to handle larger sets of data in Stock analysis.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis Outcomes 

My analysis showed that certain tickers in 2017 have better growth then 2018 in which the growth of those tickers weren't that high. I recommend to invest in ENPH and RUN as they have the great growth in 2017 & 2018.

### Performance Comparison

Comparing my Original code to the Refactoring code, which both provided the correct results, but efficiency was better in the refactoring code so we can run a larger data set without having bugs, wasting time, or computer power.
  
## Summary

- What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

The advantage of refactoring code is that the code is more efficient and runs in a short time by re-structuring of the code helps in saving speed of processing and runs pc power at low.  Refactoring code helps when you have a large data set and it needs to analysis faster. The disadvantages of Refactoring code is that it is time-consuming to fix and edit the code to run smoothly and it adds more bugs to the code that needs to be fixed.

- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

The advantage of refactoring code in VBA is shown when the code is working without any bugs and the time consumed is less, so the refactoring code uses less pc power so there is no freezing issues or bugs when running large datasets. The disadvantage of refactoring code in VBA is that the code will run many bugs until we fix the issues and it can run smoothly. This process as taken me a long time to fix.
